# ðŸš€ Mission LAIKA: Linear Algebra in Kinematics and Aerodynamics

Welcome to **Mission LAIKA**, a visual exploration of Linear Algebra through real-world applications in **kinematics** and **aerodynamics**. This project uses [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) to create mathematical animations that explain abstract concepts in a way that is easy to understand for **Aerospace Engineering** students.

---

## Current Case Studies

The animations include:

- Case Study 1: Cleared for take-off
- Case Study 5: Pitch perfect
- Case Study 15: Will the wings fall off?

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mission-LAIKA.git
cd Mission-LAIKA
```

### 2. Set up your environment

Install [Manim Community Edition](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Render an animation

Navigate to the **animation folder**, e.g.:

```bash
cd CaseStudy1
```

and run:

```bash
manim -p beginning.py
```
